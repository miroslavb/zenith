Technical report from Intelligent Internet (2026) on how an agent harness should control work that may run for days or weeks, where the dominant failure mode is *premature completion* rather than inability to make progress.

## Host audit: assurance cost and alternatives

A reproducible audit of 42 real host missions, including a Russian executive summary, full report, coverage manifest, and SQLite findings store, is available under [`analysis/zenith-host-audit/`](analysis/zenith-host-audit/). It distinguishes formal graph overhead, validator execution time, and protocol/runtime failures, then compares risk-tiered alternatives for product, infrastructure, and scientific work.

## Abstract

Long-running agents often fail not because they cannot make progress, but because they stop before the task is truly complete. We tested five harness designs across eight long-horizon tasks to isolate the control mechanisms that matter: repeated gap-finding, revisable planning, independent verification, adaptive orchestration, and stopping discipline.

RALPH is the strongest simple baseline because it forces each new session to reopen the gap between the current project state and the original requirement. But RALPH is expensive and has no principled stopping rule.

Our Zenith method keeps the useful parts of repeated review while making the loop adaptive: the orchestrator dynamically allocates workers, testers, reusable skills, replanning, and stopping decisions. In this study, Zenith achieved the best mean rank while using less than half of RALPH's per-task cost.

## Installation

### **Copy and give this to your agent harness:**
```
/goal Read the readme at https://github.com/Intelligent-Internet/zenith, detect if using claude code, codex or both, install requirements, install and run Zenith (ie uv run zenith etc like in the readme) and create a new skill called /zenith - when used (along with an additional prompt) it will call the skill: the minimum skill content should be: """First read .claude/orchestrator_prompt.md and treat it as your primary role, then use Zenith to run this mission.""" and afterwards you can add information about Zenith Harness, based on the readme and the technical report (inside the repo), and info on how to start zenith if its not already running. Change the skill to use .codex when using in codex. If both hernesses are available, make sure to add these skill to both of them correctly. Infact, there might be more harness options (hermes for example). See what is supported in §zenith/src/zenith_harness/providers.py, and for those that you detect are present, add their skills correctly. When Finished, confirm to me that Zenith is installed, running and ready, explain a bit about Zenith, and why and when to use it.
```
This will: 
* install zenith with requirements
* start zenith using uv
* create claude code and codex skills to run & use zenith
  
**Then, use /zenith like so - in claude code or codex, type:**
```
/zenith <your instruction or query>
```

### Or install it manually:

Zenith is a small MCP/ACP harness that runs a coding agent as a multi-agent orchestrator. See [`zenith/`](zenith/) for the full package.

**Requirements**

- Python 3.11+
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Node.js 22+ and `npm`
- Claude Code or Codex

**Install**

```bash
cd zenith
uv sync
uv run zenith --help
```

Install the ACP adapters globally for the agents you want Zenith to run:

```bash
# Claude workers/validators
npm install -g @agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp
command -v claude-agent-acp

# Codex workers/validators
npm install -g @agentclientprotocol/codex-acp
command -v codex-acp
```

**Initialize a workspace**

Initialize the project workspace Zenith should operate on. This is your target app/repo, not the Zenith source checkout:

```bash
# Claude Code, from this Zenith checkout
uv run zenith init --workspace-dir /path/to/your-app --agent claude

# Or Codex, from this Zenith checkout
uv run zenith init --workspace-dir /path/to/your-app --agent codex
```

**Run a mission**

Start your agent from the initialized project workspace:

```bash
cd /path/to/your-app

claude
# or
codex
```

Then ask the agent to read the generated orchestrator prompt:

```text
First read .claude/orchestrator_prompt.md and treat it as your primary role, then use Zenith to run this mission.

<your instruction or query>
```

For Codex, use:

```text
First read .codex/orchestrator_prompt.md and treat it as your primary role, then use Zenith to run this mission.

<your instruction or query>
```

## Zenith

<p align="center">
  <img src="technical_report/images/zenith.png" alt="Zenith harness architecture" width="780"/>
</p>

A single orchestrator session reads task state each turn and decides what to do next: spawn worker or tester subagents, register a reusable skill, replan, or stop. Workers and testers run in their own contexts and report back; the orchestrator integrates their results before the next decision.

## Results

### Ablation Study

To isolate the control mechanisms that matter, we compared Zenith against RALPH and three reduced harness variants across eight long-horizon tasks. Zenith achieves the best mean rank at less than half of RALPH's per-task cost.

| Method | Mean rank ↓ | Mean cost (USD/task) ↓ | Wins (of 8) ↑ |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| One-session | 5.00 | $22.21 | 0 |
| Plan-RALPH | 4.00 | $161.53 | 0 |
| Milestone-RALPH | 2.88 | $209.47 | 0 |
| RALPH | 1.75 | $407.58 | 3 |
| **Zenith** | **1.38** | **$175.68** | **5** |

<sub>*A "win" is a task on which the method ranked first; the eight wins partition the eight benchmark tasks.*</sub>
